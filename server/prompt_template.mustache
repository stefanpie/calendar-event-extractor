Given some text, extract the events from the text and format them into a json array. Each event will be a dict in the array with a key for the event_name, start_datetime, and end_datetime. The datetimes should be in the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format. If an event doesn't have an end datetime, then leave the end datetime blank.
The array should start with [START EVENTS OBJECT] and end with [END EVENTS OBJECT].

Input Text:
